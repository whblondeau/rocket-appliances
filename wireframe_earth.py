Wireframe Earth is the first Rocket Appliance. It is a graticule of coordinates
that approximates the Earth's surface.
Broadly speaking, the Wireframe Earth has two properties: the ellipsoid and
the graticule.
The ellipsoid is a solid geometric construct. In complexity and geodesic fidelity,
it can range from a sphere to a geoid.
